      "description": "The Vedic period, spanning from approximately 1500 to 500 BCE, marks a transformative era in the history of the Indian subcontinent. It represents the transition from the late Bronze Age to the early Iron Age, bridging the gap between the decline of the urban Indus Valley Civilization and the emergence of a second wave of urbanization around 600 BCE in the central Indo-Gangetic Plain."

        "details": "The foundation of this period is defined by the composition of the Vedic texts, including the Vedas, which were created between roughly 1500 and 900 BCE. These liturgical texts were composed by speakers of an Old Indo-Aryan language who migrated into the northwestern regions of the subcontinent. The Vedas are not only religious hymns but also provide insight into the social, political, and cultural aspects of early Vedic society, making them the primary source for understanding this era. Their precise oral transmission ensured the preservation of the traditions and knowledge of this period."

        "details": "Initially, Vedic society was centered in the Punjab region and was organized into tribes rather than kingdoms. It was a predominantly pastoral, patriarchal, and patrilineal society that relied on cattle herding and maintained a semi-nomadic lifestyle. However, around 1200–1000 BCE, this culture began to expand eastward into the fertile western Ganges Plain. The adoption of iron tools facilitated the clearing of dense forests, leading to a gradual shift from a pastoral existence to a more settled agricultural lifestyle. This marked the beginning of the transition from tribal organizations to more structured societies."

The Kuru Kingdom, a powerful tribal union, became a central force in codifying the orthodox sacrificial rituals that formed the core of Brahmanical ideology. Concurrently, a related but distinct Indo-Aryan culture emerged in the central Ganges Plain, known as Greater Magadha, which maintained its own traditions separate from the Vedic orthodoxy."

This period also saw the rise of the śramaṇa movements, including Jainism and Buddhism, which began to challenge the dominance of Vedic traditions. The social hierarchy established during this era became deeply ingrained, laying the groundwork for the caste system that would shape Indian society for centuries."

According to a 2010 estimate by Johnson and Grim, Vaishnavites are the largest Hindu sect, constituting about 641 million or 67.6% of Hindus. It is also called Vishnuism since it considers Vishnu as the sole supreme being leading all other Hindu deities, i.e. Mahavishnu. Its followers are called Vaishnavites or Vaishnavas, and it includes sub-sects like Krishnaism and Ramaism, which consider Krishna and Rama as the supreme beings respectively."

A merger of several popular non-Vedic theistic traditions, particularly the Bhagavata cults of Vāsudeva-krishna and Gopala-Krishna, and Narayana, developed in the 7th to 4th century BCE. It was integrated with the Vedic God Vishnu in the early centuries CE, and finalized as Vaishnavism when it developed the avatar doctrine, wherein the various non-Vedic deities are revered as distinct incarnations of the supreme God Vishnu."
